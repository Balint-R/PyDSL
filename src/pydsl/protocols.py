    """
    A protocol where its instances accepts a plain call from the input program

    on_Call does not need to follow the Protocol's signature, or even be a
    function. As such, CompileTimeCallable allows an implementing class to
    delegate its on_Call behavior to another class by having its instance under
    the on_Call attribute. This delegation often forms an attribute chain.

    Note: this class's behavior is in likeness to Python's Callable, but not
    congruent. Callable performs `type(x).__call__(x, arg1, ...)` uniformly to
    any x.
    This deviation is for the sake of ergonomics. It avoids requiring every
    CompileTimeCallable class to use a metaclass that implements
    metaclass.on_Call(x, arg1, ...) to be equivalent to x.on_Call(arg1, ...)

    If you would like x to be passed into on_Call as the first argument,
    decorate it with @classmethod.
